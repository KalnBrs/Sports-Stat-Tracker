## Overview
This is a backetball stat tracker that I built for a computer science class project. It uses python and a libary to set up a UI-Interface and to simplify the process. This application uses a json data based system for simplicity.

## Next Steps
The next steps to this prject are to:
1. Intergrate changing photoshop text variables with the data from the stat tracker
2. Compleatly automate the whole graphics process for my local AV basketball streams
